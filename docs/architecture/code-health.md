# Code Health: Architecture & Internals

Companion to the user-facing [`docs/CODE_HEALTH.md`](../CODE_HEALTH.md). This
document is for contributors: where every piece lives, how data flows from
parsed source to the dashboard, and the extension points for adding
markers, languages, coverage formats, or alerts.

> **TL;DR.** Health analysis is a deterministic, zero-LLM Python pipeline:
> tree-sitter walks every file once -> markers vote -> scores aggregate per
> category -> results land in four SQLAlchemy tables. The MCP server, CLI,
> and Next.js dashboard all read from those tables: no JSON cache, no
> intermediate files, no LLM in the loop.

## 1. Layer overview

Code Health is the **fifth intelligence layer** in Repowise, alongside Graph,
Git, Docs, and Decisions. It reads from Graph and Git but never modifies
them. Its only writes are to its own four tables.

Three architectural rules govern the whole layer:

1. **Zero LLM.** Every marker is AST, git, or coverage math.
2. **No JSON caches.** SQLite is the single source of truth; everything
   else reads from it.
3. **No new runtime dependencies.** Pure Python over tree-sitter (already
   in tree). No lizard, no jscpd, no Node.

## 3. The pipeline (init path)

`repowise init` runs `run_pipeline()` in `core/pipeline/orchestrator.py`.
`_run_health_analysis()` is a phase in that orchestrator, called between
`_run_dead_code_analysis()` and `_run_decision_extraction()`. It does four
things:

1. Builds a `{file_path: community label}` map from the graph's community
   detection so `HealthFileMetric.module` is populated (module rollups are
   never NULL).
2. Loads per-file override rules from `.repowise/health-rules.json` via
   `HealthConfig.load(repo_path)` (a no-op when the file is absent) and
   resolves them to per-file disabled sets with `to_analyzer_config()`.
3. Constructs the `HealthAnalyzer` with everything it needs: the NetworkX
   graph (for dependents), `git_meta_map` (hotspot bit, owners, co-change, bus
   factor), the `parsed_files` from the AST phase, and the module map.
4. Picks the sync or parallel path by repo size. tree-sitter releases the GIL
   during parsing, so on repos with `>= 500` parsed files `analyze_async()`
   (asyncio gather over worker threads) gives a real wall-clock speedup;
   smaller repos run `analyze()` on a single thread.

The returned report rides on `PipelineResult.health_report`. Then
`core/pipeline/persist.py` writes it in one session: `save_health_metrics`,
`save_health_findings` (only when there are findings), and a
`save_health_snapshot` carrying the three KPIs plus a `{path: score}` map for
trend tracking (rolling 50-row window per repo).

---

## 4. Inside `HealthAnalyzer.analyze()`

A single pass over the parsed file list. For each file the analyzer:

1. **Walks the AST** (`_walk`): `walk_file(language, source)` returns a
   `FileComplexity` of functions and classes. Each `FunctionComplexity` carries
   name, line range, nloc, ccn, max nesting, cognitive complexity, bumps, and
   param count; each `ClassComplexity` carries method count, total nloc, the
   method list, LCOM4, max method ccn, and field count.
2. **Populates symbol complexity** (`_populate_symbol_complexity`): writes
   `max(ccn)` into `Symbol.complexity_estimate` as a side effect, so the
   `ContextAssembler` symbol ranker benefits even when a caller never touches
   the health tables.
3. **Evaluates the file** (`_evaluate_file`): builds a `FileContext` (nloc,
   `has_test_file`, module, per-function and per-class metrics, the per-file
   `git_meta`, graph in-degree as `dependents_count`, the repo-wide p80 of
   in-degree used as the `brain_method` floor, coverage fields when ingested,
   and the file's clone slice), runs `detect_all()`, scores with `score_file()`,
   and attaches per-finding impacts.

After the loop, `compute_kpis()` runs over the metrics and the set of hotspot
paths (`git_meta_map[path]["is_hotspot"]`), and the analyzer returns a
`HealthReport(findings, metrics, kpis)`.

Duplication runs **once up-front** (it is cross-file by nature); each
`FileContext` gets a slice of the global clone report. The `dry_violation`
marker reads `ctx.clones` and ranks pairs by co-change frequency from
`git_meta_map[path]["co_change_partners_json"]`, so active clones rank higher
than dormant ones.

---

## 5. The 26 markers and their categories

Each marker is a stateless class implementing the `Biomarker` Protocol from
`biomarkers/base.py`: a `name` (`"brain_method"`, `"nested_complexity"`, ...), a
`category` (see `scoring.CATEGORY_CAPS`), and a `detect(ctx: FileContext)` method
returning a list of `BiomarkerResult`s.

| Category               | Cap  | Markers |
|------------------------|------|------------|
| Organizational         | −3.5 | developer_congestion, knowledge_loss, hidden_coupling, function_hotspot, code_age_volatility, ownership_risk, churn_risk, change_entropy, co_change_scatter, prior_defect |
| Structural complexity  | −2.5 | brain_method, low_cohesion, god_class, nested_complexity, bumpy_road, complex_conditional |
| Test coverage          | −2.0 | untested_hotspot, coverage_gap |
| Test coverage (cont.)  | −2.0 | coverage_gradient |
| Size & complexity      | −1.5 | complex_method, large_method, primitive_obsession |
| Duplication            | −1.0 | dry_violation |
| Test quality           | −0.5 | large_assertion_block, duplicated_assertion_block |
| Error handling         | −0.5 | error_handling |

`large_assertion_block` and `duplicated_assertion_block` are the two
**test-quality** smells (see §5.3). They fire only on test files and sit in
a deliberately small category so a noisy test can't dominate its own score.
`large_method` is now gated on a minimal CCN floor (≥ 2) so a long-but-flat
body (a big data literal) reads as layout, not a complexity smell: a small
step toward decoupling the score from raw file size.

`ownership_risk` (long-run minor-contributor dispersion, Bird et al.) and
`churn_risk` (size-normalized relative churn, Nagappan-Ball) are git-only
process signals computed from `top_authors_json` / `lines_added_90d` /
`churn_percentile`: fields the git indexer already produces. `change_entropy`
(Hassan's History Complexity Metric) and `co_change_scatter` (breadth of
co-change coupling, D'Ambros) are likewise git-only and read the
`change_entropy` / `change_entropy_pct` fields (see §5.1) and
`co_change_partners_json`. `knowledge_loss` is activity-gated so
abandoned-but-stable files (the survivor effect) no longer fire.

`prior_defect` (recent bug-fix history, Ostrand-Weyuker / Kim's "bug cache")
is the other git-only process signal: the count of bug-fix commits touching a
file in the trailing ~6-month window, read from `prior_defect_count`. The
git indexer classifies a commit as a fix with the **same keyword rule the
defect benchmark labels fixes with** (`_constants.is_fix_commit`), counts only
non-merge commits inside the window, and anchors the window to the index's
`as_of` reference (`REPOWISE_GIT_WINDOW_ANCHOR`): so scoring a historical T0
checkout measures the fixes *before* T0, never leaking the post-T0 fixes that
form the benchmark's labels. It carries a **neutral (1.0) weight by design**:
on the calibration corpus prior-defect history is largely redundant with the
existing process signals (correlation ≈ +0.59 with `change_entropy`, +0.38 with
churn; calibrated coefficient ≈ +0.02, effort-aware Popt gain within bootstrap
noise), so it is not boosted as a predictor. It ships for its **explanatory**
value, not for a measured accuracy lift: "this file was bug-fixed N times
recently" is immediately actionable, and it uniquely flags a few files the
other signals miss.

`coverage_gradient` makes the test-coverage signal **continuous**. The two
binary coverage gates (`untested_hotspot`, `coverage_gap`) only fire below hard
thresholds (≈40–60% line coverage), so on a well-tested codebase (where most
files sit at 85–99%) the score is effectively blind to coverage even though the
uncovered fraction still carries defect signal. `coverage_gradient` deducts
health in direct proportion to that fraction: `4.0 × (1 − line_coverage_pct/100)`
health points, clamped by its category cap (binding at ≥50% uncovered). It uses
the `deduction` override on `BiomarkerResult` (a continuous magnitude that
replaces the discrete severity-to-deduction table for that finding) so it stays
**linear and per-finding attributable** (the `health_impact` contract holds). It
is **silent when no coverage report was ingested** (`line_coverage_pct is None`):
absent coverage is never imputed as uncovered. It lives in its own capped
category (`test_coverage_gradient`, −2.0) so the additive continuous signal
neither squeezes nor is squeezed by the binary gates, and it skips test files.
Calibrated offline against the defect corpus, it recovers **+0.043 corpus AUC
[95% CI +0.023, +0.061]** on the covered subset (≈65% of the continuous-feature
ceiling), Popt-neutral, and is exactly zero on repos without ingested coverage:
a purely additive improvement.

`low_cohesion` (LCOM4) and `god_class` are the two **class-level**
structural smells. They read `ctx.class_metrics`, the per-class aggregates
the walker now emits alongside per-function metrics (see §5.2).
`brain_method`'s centrality gate is **language-agnostic**: instead of a
fixed `dependents ≥ 8`, it fires when a file is in the repo's top quintile
of connected files (`repo_dependents_p80`, computed once per analyze) or
clears the absolute hub bar of 8: so it no longer goes silent on
sparse-graph languages (TS barrels, Rust) whose in-degrees are lower than
Python's.

### 5.1 Change-entropy git-layer fields

`change_entropy` is computed during the **single** FULL-tier co-change walk
(`ingestion/git_indexer/co_change.py::compute_co_changes_and_entropy`): no
extra `git log` subprocess. For each commit touching a set of tracked files
`F` (with `2 ≤ |F| ≤ 30`; wider commits are dropped as noise, Hassan's filter),
the commit's entropy is `log2(|F|)`, distributed uniformly (`1/|F|` per file)
and decayed with the same τ=180d half-life as co-change. The decay-weighted sum
per file is `git_meta["change_entropy"]`. `enrich.compute_percentiles` then
derives `change_entropy_pct` by ranking **only files with positive entropy**
(zero-entropy files, the ESSENTIAL tier or files only ever changed alone,
keep pct 0.0 so the marker stays silent). Both fields are persisted on
`git_metadata` (migration `0025`) and the additive-reconcile path back-fills
them on legacy DBs.

### 5.2 Class-level walker metrics (LCOM4)

The complexity walker emits a `ClassComplexity` per class-like node for
languages that opt in (`LanguageNodeMap.class_kinds` non-empty: Python,
TS/JS, Java, Kotlin, Rust `impl`, C++, C#; Go has no grouping node). LCOM4 is the number of
connected components in the graph whose nodes are the class's methods and
whose edges link methods that share an instance field or call one another.
Member references are detected per-language via `self`/`this`/`$this`
member-access nodes. **Safety valve:** a class with no detected member
references (a static utility, or an unmapped language) reports `lcom4 = 1`
("no signal") rather than `len(methods)`, so adding a language can only
turn signal on, never produce a false-positive flood. See
`complexity/README.md` for the full heuristic and its limits.

`error_handling` is the **advisory maintainability** marker: swallowed
catches (an empty/comment-only `catch` / `except: pass` body), Python
catch-all `except:` / `except Exception:`, Rust `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` /
panic-family macros, and Go's empty `if err != nil {}` or blank-identifier
discard of a call's error. The walker collects each occurrence (with its
line) in a whole-tree pass (module-level code included) reusing the
`LanguageNodeMap` catch kinds for the seven catch-shaped languages and
dedicated recognizers for Rust/Go; an unsupported language or parse failure
yields no hits ("no signal", never a guess). The marker emits one LOW
finding per occurrence (0.15 after its floored 0.5 weight) in its own
`error_handling` category capped at −0.5, mirroring `test_quality`'s
advisory framing. It is deliberately **excluded from the defect-weight
calibration**: on the 21-repo / 9-language T0 benchmark it is AUC-neutral
(OOF delta ≈ 0, CI crosses zero) but size-orthogonal and the least redundant
signal tested, and it ships because users expect `except: pass` flagged:
bounded so it can never move a file by more than half a point.

### 5.3 Assertion-block walker metrics (test-quality)

The same single walker pass records `assertion_blocks` on each
`FunctionComplexity`: runs of ≥ 2 consecutive assertion statements, each
`(start_line, end_line, count)`. A statement counts as an assertion when it
is a bare `assert` (`LanguageNodeMap.assert_kinds`) or its expression is a
call (`assert_call_kinds`) whose callee name starts with `assert` or
`expect`: covering `assertEqual` / `assert_eq!` / `expect(...).toBe(...)`
across xUnit and BDD styles. Opt-in per language, with all nine full-tier
languages (Python, TS/JS, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, C++, C#) mapped;
a language that maps neither field simply emits no blocks.
`large_assertion_block` flags a single run ≥ 15; `duplicated_assertion_block`
intersects the clone report with assertion spans. Both gate on
`coverage.is_test_file(path)` so production code is never touched.

`biomarkers/registry.py` is an **explicit list**, not auto-discovery:
keeps the registration order deterministic and lets tests inject extras
via `registered_biomarkers(extra=...)`.

---

## 6. Scoring (`scoring.py`)

Every file starts at **10.0**. Each finding contributes a per-severity
deduction (`low=0.3, medium=0.7, high=1.2, critical=2.0`), scaled by the
marker's calibrated weight multiplier (§6.1). `score_file()` then groups the
weighted findings by category, sums the raw deductions per category, and either
accepts the sum or, when it exceeds the cap, scales every per-finding deduction
in that category proportionally so the total equals the cap. This keeps the
UI's "this finding cost you X points" honest after capping. The final score is
clamped to `[1.0, 10.0]`. So even ten critical structural findings can drive
structural complexity down by at most 3.5 points, not 20.

The per-finding scaled deduction lands on `HealthFinding.health_impact`
via `attach_impacts()`: that's what the dashboard's "−2.0" badge shows.

Snapshot tests in `tests/unit/health/test_scoring_snapshot.py` lock the
category caps, severity deductions, marker-to-category mapping, and two
known-fixture scores. A retune intentionally requires updating the
snapshot in the same PR.

### 6.1 Calibrated weight multipliers

`scoring._BIOMARKER_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER` lets the strongest empirical predictors
deduct more than the uniform severity table alone allows. The multipliers are
**calibrated offline against a defect corpus, not hand-tuned**: each file is
scored at the pre-window commit (T0, no leakage) and an L2-logistic regression,
with NLOC as an explicit control, fits each marker's defect lift beyond file
size. The runtime stays deterministic; only the learned constants ship. The
full calibration, with confidence intervals, is published in the
[benchmark report](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise-bench/blob/master/health-defect/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md)
and reproduced by `local-stash/calibrate_health_weights.py`.

| Weight | Markers | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1.8 | `co_change_scatter` | Strongest calibrated predictor. |
| 1.51 | `change_entropy` | History Complexity Metric; second strongest. |
| 1.38 | `ownership_risk` | Long-run minor-contributor dispersion. |
| 1.34 | `nested_complexity` | Strongest structural predictor. |
| 1.1–1.33 | remaining structural complexity / size markers | Moderate calibrated lift. |
| 1.3 / 1.2 / 1.1 | `untested_hotspot` / `churn_risk` / `code_age_volatility` | Coverage-dependent and rarely-firing; keep prior weights the corpus could not fairly measure. |
| 1.0 | `prior_defect` | Neutral by design: largely redundant with the other process signals, kept for its explanatory value. |
| 0.5 (floored) | `developer_congestion`, `dry_violation`, `low_cohesion`, `brain_method`, `primitive_obsession`, `bumpy_road` | Fire widely but proved weak under leakage-free scoring; kept as maintainability and parity signals, not disabled. |
| 0.4 (de-rated) | `knowledge_loss` | Weakest of the floored set. |

The same marker stream feeds the **maintainability** signal under an
independent, expert-set weight table (the floored smells deduct at full weight
there), and the **performance** signal under its own bounded `performance`
category. The three signals share one scoring kernel against separate
weight/category/cap tables and never feed back into each other; see the
[user guide](../CODE_HEALTH.md#three-health-signals-defect-risk-maintainability-and-performance)
for what each signal surfaces and why the overall score stays the defect score.

---

## 7. KPIs

Three repo-level numbers, computed in `compute_kpis()`:

- **Hotspot Health**: NLOC-weighted average over files where
  `git_meta_map[path]["is_hotspot"]` is true.
- **Average Health**: NLOC-weighted average over all files.
- **Worst Performer**: lowest-scoring file + its score.

These flow into `HealthSnapshot` rows (rolling 50 per repo) and feed the
CLI status one-liner, the `get_overview()` MCP block, and the dashboard
KPI cards.

---

## 8. Trends (`trends.py`)

State-free: callers pass an oldest-first list of snapshot rows. Two
alerts:

- **Declining Health**: current is ≥ `DECLINE_THRESHOLD` (default 0.5)
  below the snapshot `DECLINE_LOOKBACK` (5) positions back. Fires on the
  6th+ snapshot.
- **Predicted Decline**: the three most recent snapshots are each
  strictly below the one before. Magnitude is not required; direction is
  the signal.

`recent_kpis(history, limit=10)` returns a newest-first serialised view
for the CLI table and MCP `get_health(include=["trend"])` response.

### Per-file trajectory

Snapshots also store a compact `{path: score}` map (`per_file_scores_json`),
so the same window yields a single file's score-over-time series:

- `file_score_series(history, path)`: oldest-first `FileTrendPoint`s,
  skipping snapshots that don't carry the file. Returns `[]` below two
  points (silent on thin history). This is the exact function the PR bot
  reuses for its in-comment sparkline.
- `file_trend(history, path)`: wraps the series with `current` / `previous`
  / `delta` and a `declining` flag (the per-file mirror of the alerts above:
  ≥ `DECLINE_THRESHOLD` below the lookback point, or
  `PREDICTED_DECLINE_CONSECUTIVE` consecutive drops). `snapshot_count` is the
  full window size so a young repo is distinguishable from a file missing in
  older snapshots.

Both are state-free; the server serialises `FileTrend` via
`_file_trend_to_dict` and embeds it in the file-detail health block, the
health-breakdown response, and the standalone trend route (§13).

### Per-file signals (`signals.py`)

The same state-free pattern, applied to the git-layer + topology fields we
already persist but only buried inside marker detail cards (or omitted
entirely). `file_signals(git_meta, degrees)` joins one `GitMetadata` row with
the file's graph degree into a `FileSignals` grouped as **Process**
(`prior_defect_count`, `change_entropy_pct` normalized 0-100, 90-day line
churn, `age_days`), **People** (recent vs all-time owner + commit share), and
**Topology** (`in_degree` / `out_degree`). No recompute: pure surfacing.

The honesty rule mirrors the trend: a field is `None` only when its *source
row* is absent (no git history means process/people silent; not a graph node
means topology silent), never imputed; a genuine `prior_defect_count` of `0` is kept
as a real signal. The server serialises it via `_file_signals_to_dict` and
embeds it in the file-detail health block and the breakdown response (§13); MCP
attaches a null-dropped copy to the `get_context` health block (§12). Mirrored
as `FileSignals` in `@repowise-dev/types/health`; rendered by the shared
`file-signals-panel.tsx` in both the drawer and the file-page Health tab.

---

## 9. Incremental analysis: the `repowise update` path

Full re-analysis would be wasteful on commit-sized diffs, so
`HealthAnalyzer.analyze()` accepts a `changed_files` set. When it is present:
duplication still runs full-repo (a changed file's clone partner may be
unchanged); the per-file loop skips files not in `changed_files`; and the KPIs
are **not** recomputed, since the subset would bias them. The dashboard
recomputes KPIs from the merged DB rows instead.

`update_cmd.py` builds the changed-files set from
`change_detector.get_changed_files()`, runs the analyzer, and persists through a
helper that uses the **upsert** variants (`upsert_health_metrics`,
`upsert_health_findings`, scoped to the changed paths) so unchanged files keep
their existing rows. The full-init writers (`save_health_findings`,
`save_health_metrics`) still use delete-then-insert: simpler, and the cost is
amortised across the whole `repowise init`.

---

## 10. Persistence schema

Four tables, all in the repo's `.repowise/wiki.db`. Foreign-keyed to
`repositories.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

### `health_findings`

One row per marker hit. Lifecycle: `open → acknowledged | resolved |
false_positive` (matches Dead Code). Bulk-deleted-and-rewritten on full
init; selectively upserted on `repowise update`.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID PK |
| `repository_id` | FK |
| `file_path` | indexed |
| `biomarker_type` | `brain_method`, `nested_complexity`, ... |
| `severity` | `low` / `medium` / `high` / `critical` |
| `function_name` | nullable for file-level findings |
| `line_start`, `line_end` | nullable |
| `details_json` | per-marker evidence (CCN values, clone span, etc.) |
| `health_impact` | per-finding scaled deduction |
| `reason` | one-line summary string |
| `status` | lifecycle |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | datetime |

### `health_file_metrics`

One row per file (unique on `(repository_id, file_path)`). Read directly
by the dashboard's file table.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `score` | 1.0–10.0 final |
| `max_ccn`, `max_nesting`, `nloc` | aggregate function metrics |
| `duplication_pct` | percent of NLOC covered by clones; nullable |
| `has_test_file` | paired or heuristic |
| `line_coverage_pct`, `branch_coverage_pct` | nullable |
| `module` | community label from graph; falls back to top-level dir |
| `updated_at` | datetime |

### `health_snapshots`

KPI + per-file score history. Rolling delete on insert keeps the latest
50 per repo (`HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` in `crud.py`).

### `coverage_files`

Per-file coverage, overwritten on every `--coverage` run. Carries the
explicit `covered_lines_json` array so the `coverage_gap` marker can
flag the exact uncovered surface, not just the percent.

---

## 11. CLI surface

`packages/cli/src/repowise/cli/commands/health_cmd.py`. Mirrors the
dead-code command's Click structure.

```bash
repowise health                            # KPIs + lowest-scoring files + findings
repowise health --file path/to/x.py        # deep-dive one file
repowise health --module packages/server   # restrict to a directory prefix
repowise health --refactoring-targets      # ranked by impact / effort
repowise health --trend                    # last 10 snapshots + active alerts
repowise health --coverage coverage.lcov   # ingest coverage; can repeat
repowise health --coverage-format cobertura
repowise health --format json | jq ...
repowise health --safe-only                # confidence ≥ 0.8 only (placeholder)
```

`repowise status` queries the same tables for a one-line summary:

```
Health: 7.4 (avg) · 6.2 (hotspots) · 2.1 (worst: packages/server/.../app.py)
```

`repowise update` is unchanged from the user's perspective: health is
silently re-scored for changed files only.

---

## 12. MCP surface

### `get_health(targets?, include?, repo?, limit?)`

Defined in `tool_health.py`. Modes:

- **Dashboard mode** (`targets=None`): returns repo-level KPIs (with the
  repo `band`) + the NLOC-weighted `distribution` across the 3 bands +
  `worst_files` (top N lowest-scoring) + `top_findings` + a per-module
  `modules` rollup.
- **Targeted mode** (`targets=[...]`): returns full `metrics` +
  `findings` for the listed paths, plus a per-file `trends` block (compact
  score series + `current` + `delta` + `declining`) for any target with at
  least two snapshots of history. Targets prefixed `module:foo` expand to
  the file set in that module.

`include` flags layer richer data:

| Flag | Adds |
|---|---|
| `"biomarkers"` | full findings list (already present in target mode) |
| `"coverage"` | per-file coverage rows + summary |
| `"refactoring"` | deterministic `suggestion` text on every finding |
| `"trend"` | snapshot diff + alerts + last 10 KPI rows |

### Enrichments on existing tools

- `get_risk(targets)`: each per-target row carries `health_score`,
  `top_biomarkers`, `coverage_pct`, `branch_coverage_pct`.
- `get_context(targets, include=["health"])`: per-file `score`,
  `max_ccn`, `max_nesting`, `nloc`, `module`, `duplication_pct`, top
  2 markers (each with a `suggestion` string), a coverage block, and a
  null-dropped `signals` block (process/people/topology, see §8).
- `get_overview()`: adds a `code_health` block: avg, repo `band`, hotspot,
  worst performer, open finding count, and the NLOC-weighted `distribution`.

Every response carries the standard `_meta` envelope via `build_meta()`.

---

## 13. REST surface

`packages/server/src/repowise/server/routers/code_health.py`. All under
`/api/repos/{repo_id}/health/`:

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /overview` | summary (with repo `band`) + `distribution` + lowest-scoring files + top findings + module rollup |
| `GET /badge.svg` | self-rendered flat SVG health badge (color + `N.N/10`, no letter) |
| `GET /badge.json` | Shields.io endpoint-badge payload (`schemaVersion`/`label`/`message`/`color`/`band`) |
| `GET /files` | per-file metrics |
| `GET /files/breakdown` | one file's metric + score breakdown + findings + suggestions + per-file `trend` + `signals` |
| `GET /files/trend` | one file's score-over-time series + current delta + `declining` flag (`?file_path=`) |
| `GET /trend` | repo KPI history + alerts + last-two-snapshot per-file deltas |
| `GET /findings` | findings list (filterable by biomarker_type, severity, file_path) |
| `GET /coverage` | coverage summary + per-file rows |
| `POST /coverage` | ingest a coverage report (used by some CI integrations) |
| `GET /refactoring-targets` | ranked by `total_impact / effort_bucket` |
| `GET /churn-complexity` | churn × complexity scatter points (one per churned file: `commit_count_90d`, `max_ccn`, `nloc`, `score`, `churn_percentile`) |
| `GET /modules` | NLOC-weighted module rollup table |

Auth is the standard `verify_api_key` dependency from
`server/deps.py`.

---

## 14. Web dashboard

Three routes under `/repos/[id]/health/`:

| Route | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/health` | KPI cards, lowest-scoring file table, top findings, **per-module rollup** (added in Phase 4) |
| `/health/coverage` | Coverage summary, untested-hotspot warnings, module-level bars, per-file drill-down |
| `/health/refactoring-targets` | Cards sorted by impact-per-effort, each with severity, marker, score, NLOC, effort bucket, **deterministic suggestion** |

Plus a sidecar `HealthRisksPanel` on the Hotspots, Ownership, and Graph
pages: surfaces the lowest-scoring files inline without touching the
shared table/graph components. The **Hotspots & churn** tab carries the
`ChurnComplexityQuadrant` (fed by `GET /churn-complexity`), toggleable in
place with the existing churn × bus-factor scatter; the file Health tab
carries the per-function "Functions by churn" blame table.

All visual primitives live in `packages/ui/src/health/` so the hosted
`frontend/` repo (separate git checkout) can reuse them: port is mostly
data fetching + auth.

---

## 15. CLAUDE.md integration

The auto-generated `CLAUDE.md` includes a `## Code health` section when
the health tables are populated. The block is intentionally short;
filter rules in `core/generation/editor_files/data.py`:

- Score ≤ 5.0 **and** file is a hotspot
- Any Brain Method in a file with > 10 dependents
- Any Untested Hotspot
- DRY violations > 70 % similarity
- Declining trend (> 1.0 drop in last 5 snapshots)

Everything else is filtered out so the CLAUDE.md doesn't drown a fresh
agent in noise. The Jinja stanza lives in
`core/generation/templates/claude_md.j2`.

---

## 16. Configuration: `.repowise/health-rules.json`

`.repowise/health-rules.json` is user-authored (the **only** JSON file in the
layer) and is loaded by `HealthConfig.load(repo_path)`. It carries repo-wide and
per-path `disabled_biomarkers` and `severity_overrides`, keyed by an fnmatch
glob over the repo-relative POSIX path (`path`, with `path_glob` and `glob` as
accepted aliases). `to_analyzer_config(file_paths)` resolves the globs to
per-file disabled sets, which the engine honors in `_evaluate_file()`. The
schema and examples are in the
[user guide](../CODE_HEALTH.md#configuration).

---

## 17. Performance

Plan §4 P4.6 targets **< 30 s on a 3,000-file synthetic repo**. The
parallel path in `HealthAnalyzer.analyze_async()` parallelises tree-sitter
parsing across worker threads (`asyncio.gather` + `asyncio.to_thread`).
tree-sitter releases the GIL on parse, so this scales on single-process
CPython.

The orchestrator chooses the parallel path automatically when
`len(parsed_files) >= 500`. The benchmark lives at
`tests/integration/test_health_perf_benchmark.py` and is marked `slow`
(opt-in via `pytest -m slow` or `make health-bench`).

Other perf notes:

- **Duplication is O(total_tokens).** Bucket walk is near-linear on
  repos with low duplication.
- **Walker re-parses files** because `ParsedFile` doesn't retain a
  tree-sitter `Tree` across the ingestion boundary. Acceptable (~1 ms
  per file); switching to a shared parse cache is a Phase 5 stretch.
- **No N² loops in scoring.** Category aggregation is O(findings).

---

## 18. Testing

| Suite | What it locks |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/health/test_complexity_walker.py` | Per-language CCN, nesting, cognitive assertions on handcrafted fixtures |
| `tests/unit/health/test_<biomarker>.py` | Each marker: positive in two languages + one negative |
| `tests/unit/health/test_duplication.py` | Tokenizer normalization, rolling-hash determinism, co-change weighting |
| `tests/unit/health/test_coverage_parsers.py` | LCOV / Cobertura / Clover / repowise-JSON happy paths + edge cases |
| `tests/unit/health/test_scoring.py` | Deduction caps, clamping, KPI math |
| `tests/unit/health/test_scoring_snapshot.py` | **Stability guard**: caps, severity table, marker-to-category mapping, two known fixture scores |
| `tests/unit/health/test_trends.py` | Declining + predicted alerts, ordering, per-file series + `file_trend` |
| `tests/unit/health/test_signals.py` | `file_signals` join: no-signal vs real-zero, entropy 0-1 to 0-100, owner handoff |
| `tests/unit/health/test_churn_complexity.py` | `churn_complexity_points`: no-churn omission, complexity never filters, danger-product sort, percentile scaling |
| `tests/unit/health/test_suggestions.py` | Suggestion strings keyed correctly |
| `tests/unit/health/test_health_config.py` | `.repowise/health-rules.json` parsing + glob matching |
| `tests/integration/test_health_coverage_integration.py` | End-to-end LCOV -> analyzer -> coverage_gap fires |
| `tests/integration/test_health_perf_benchmark.py` | 30 s budget on 3,000 synthetic files (`-m slow`) |

99 unit tests + 2 integration tests at time of writing. Run with
`make health-check`.

---

## 19. Extension points

### Add a marker

1. New file under `biomarkers/` implementing the `Biomarker` Protocol.
2. Append to `_DETECTOR_FACTORIES` in `biomarkers/registry.py`.
3. Add the marker-to-category mapping in
   `scoring._BIOMARKER_CATEGORY`.
4. Add a suggestion template in `suggestions._TEMPLATES`.
5. Add at least three test cases (two positive in different languages,
   one negative).
6. Update `biomarkers/README.md`'s "Registered v1 detectors" list.

### Add a language to the complexity walker

Add one `LanguageNodeMap` entry to `complexity/languages.py` mapping the
language's tree-sitter control-flow node-type names to abstract `BRANCH`
/ `LOOP` / `TRY` / `BOOLEAN_OP` categories. Add a fixture under
`tests/fixtures/lang_samples/<lang>/`. **No `.scm` files needed**: those
are owned by the ingestion parser.

### Add a coverage format

Drop a parser under `coverage/` returning a `CoverageReport`. Route to it
from `coverage/detector.parse`. Stdlib-only (no extra XML libraries).

### Add a per-file override

Users (not contributors) author `.repowise/health-rules.json`. To add
a new override key (beyond `disabled_biomarkers`), extend
`HealthConfig` and thread it through `to_analyzer_config()` ->
`engine._evaluate_file()`.

---

## 20. Where the layer deliberately stops

A short list of things the v1 layer **does not** do, by design. Future
phases may revisit; the constraints kept v1 shippable.

- **No LLM-generated suggestions.** `suggestions.py` is static
  templates. An optional LLM mode is Phase 5, gated behind an explicit
  flag.
- **No symbol-level scoring.** Score lives at the file granularity to
  match how engineers think about refactor units. Symbol-level CCN
  still feeds the file score via `function_metrics`.
- **No `complexity_estimate` propagation backfill.** The walker writes
  the field as a side effect during the current run; old indexes don't
  get touched until a re-index.
- **No predictive ML on trends.** `Predicted Decline` is a 3-snapshot
  direction check, not a model. (Commit-level change risk is a separate,
  shipped surface: the `analysis/change_risk/` package behind
  `repowise risk` scores a commit or base..head range with a calibrated
  logistic model.)
- **No letter grade.** The 1–10 score is the single number. The only
  categorical layer is the 3 defect-backed bands (Healthy/Warning/Alert,
  `grading.py`); a letter on top would be a third overlapping scale with
  arbitrary cliffs. The legacy 4-step `scoreBand` in `ui/health/tokens.ts`
  is retained only as a finer color ramp for file-table pills, not a
  labeling scheme: surfaced band labels and the distribution use the 3
  bands.

---

## 21. Quick lookup: where do I edit X?

| I want to... | Edit... |
|---|---|
| Tweak a category cap | `scoring.CATEGORY_CAPS` (snapshot test will fail; update it) |
| Tweak a severity deduction | `scoring._SEVERITY_DEDUCTION` (ditto) |
| Add a new marker | `biomarkers/*.py`, `registry.py`, `scoring.py`, `suggestions.py` |
| Change the suggestion text for a marker | `suggestions._TEMPLATES` |
| Adjust the trend-alert threshold | `trends.DECLINE_THRESHOLD` / `DECLINE_LOOKBACK` |
| Change snapshot retention | `crud.HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION` |
| Add a new MCP `include` flag | `tool_health.py`: append handling near the existing `"coverage"` / `"refactoring"` branches |
| Add a new REST route | `routers/code_health.py`: auth is wired at the router level |
| Add a new dashboard view | new file under `packages/web/src/app/repos/[id]/health/`, primitives under `packages/ui/src/health/` |
| Add a CLI flag | `packages/cli/src/repowise/cli/commands/health_cmd.py` |
| Wire the analyzer into a new entry point | call `HealthAnalyzer.analyze()` directly; persist via the upsert variants if your caller is incremental |
