# Repowise Computed Glossary

This glossary describes the data Repowise computes while indexing, analyzing,
generating, serving, and exporting a repository. It is based on the code paths in
`packages/core`, `packages/server`, and `packages/cli`, not only on README files.

Use this as the vocabulary map for wiki pages, graph records, risk signals,
workspace overlays, MCP responses, and CLI output.

## Code Health And Defect-Score Benchmark Metrics

| Term | Definition | Computed by | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROC AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) | A ranking-quality measure for a binary classifier. Given one file that later received a bug fix and one that did not, it is the probability the model scores the buggy file as riskier. 0.5 is random, 1.0 is perfect separation. Repowise's defect score reaches a cross-project mean of 0.737 across 21 repositories. | Defect-score benchmark harness (cross-project validation) | `roc_auc: 0.737` |
| Popt (effort-aware ranking) | A normalized cumulative-lift (Alberg-curve) score that ranks files by predicted risk against review effort measured in lines of code. It rewards a model that concentrates real defects in the fewest lines a reviewer would read. 0 is worst, 1 is best. It complements ROC AUC, which ignores file size. | Defect-score benchmark harness (cross-project validation) | `popt: 0.58` |
| LCOM4 (Lack of Cohesion of Methods, version 4) | The number of connected components formed by a class's methods when two methods are linked if they share a field or one calls the other. 1 means a cohesive class; a value of 2 or more means the methods split into groups that share nothing, a signal the class should be split (the basis of the low_cohesion marker and the Extract Class refactoring). | `analysis/health/biomarkers/low_cohesion.py`, `analysis/health/complexity/class_analysis.py` | `lcom4: 3` |

## Example End-To-End Computation

For a file `src/auth/session.py`, a typical Repowise index can compute:

1. `FileInfo`: `language="python"`, `is_test=false`, `is_entry_point=false`.
2. `ParsedFile`: symbols such as `src/auth/session.py::SessionStore`, imports such as `from .redis import client`, calls such as `client.get()`.
3. Graph records: a file node, symbol nodes, `defines`, `imports`, `calls`, and maybe `framework` or `dynamic_*` edges.
4. Graph metrics: `pagerank=0.013`, `betweenness=0.004`, `community_id=2`, `community_label="auth"`, `cohesion=0.18`.
5. Git metadata: `commit_count_90d=11`, `primary_owner_name="Asha"`, `temporal_hotspot_score=2.1`, `churn_percentile=0.88`, `is_hotspot=true`.
6. Analysis rows: maybe a security finding `hardcoded_secret`, or a decision record from `# DECISION: store sessions in Redis`.
7. Generated docs: `file_page:src/auth/session.py`, source hash, token counts, summary, freshness, and vector/FTS entries.
8. Risk output: `hotspot_score=0.88`, trend `increasing`, risk type `churn-heavy`, co-change partners, test-gap flag, and an impact surface.
