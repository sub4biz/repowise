/**
 * Build high-quality AI-agent prompts for the code-health surface.
 *
 * Two prompt kinds today:
 *   - `buildAiPrompt(target)` — refactor one file: every biomarker hit,
 *     line range, score deduction, and constraint needed to act.
 *   - `buildCoverageAiPrompt(row)` — add tests for one uncovered or
 *     under-covered file.
 *
 * Both are deliberately structured (role → file → state → tasks →
 * constraints → completion contract) so the agent doesn't have to ask
 * follow-up questions before making its first move.
