"""Shared LLM page-generation core for ``repowise init``.

Both the single-repo flow (:mod:`.command`) and the per-repo workspace flow
(:mod:`.workspace`) need the same four steps — pick a coverage level, estimate
cost, gate on the estimate, then run generation + knowledge-graph enrichment and
flush the cost ledger. Those steps used to be copy-pasted across the two flows;
they now live here once, with the callers supplying only their distinct
rendering and control-flow (the single-repo flow prints a full plan table and
returns a "declined" flag; the workspace flow prints a compact line and raises
:class:`CostGateDeclined`).
