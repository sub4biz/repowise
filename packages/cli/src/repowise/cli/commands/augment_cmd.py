"""``repowise augment`` — hook-driven context enrichment for AI coding agents.

Reads Claude Code or Codex hook payloads from stdin (JSON) and writes
targeted enrichment back as a hook response.

Design philosophy: an enrichment hook is only valuable when it tells the
agent something the raw tool output didn't. Anything else is noise the
agent has to scroll past. So the hook fires on every Grep/Glob/Bash but
returns *nothing* most of the time, and only speaks up when there is
asymmetric, durable value:

  PostToolUse → Grep / Glob
    * Zero-result rescue: grep returned 0 hits but the wiki has a
      semantic match (FTS on docs, fuzzy symbol match, decision record
      mention). Surfaces the closest hit so the agent doesn't burn
      another round on a synonym.
    * Triage on flood: grep returned a large unfocused result set
      (>=_TRIAGE_THRESHOLD lines). Surfaces the top 3 files by
      PageRank so the agent can prioritise. The raw matches are still
      visible — this is just a ranking lens.
    * Skip otherwise: a focused result set means the agent already
      found what it wanted; further graph context is just noise.

Codex SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit: adds short repowise MCP usage guidance.

  PostToolUse → Bash
    * After a successful git commit/merge/rebase/cherry-pick/pull, if
      the wiki HEAD has drifted from .repowise/state.json's last sync
      commit AND no `repowise update` is in flight AND we haven't
      already warned for this HEAD, emit a one-line stale-wiki notice.

  PostToolUse → Read
    * Skeleton nudge: a large Read of an indexed file gets a one-line
      pointer at the skeleton surface (get_context include=["skeleton"]),
      with a cheap bounds-arithmetic estimate of the saving. Once per file
      per session.
    * Stale-read notice: when this file was Edited/Written after the
      session's previous Read of it, flag that earlier excerpts are stale.
      Once per file per session, never blocking.

  PostToolUse → Edit / Write
    * Record the edit in the per-session state file so a later Read can
      detect staleness. Emits nothing itself (Claude clients); Codex
      lifecycle hooks additionally get the index-staleness reminder below.

  PostToolUse → edit tools (Codex)
    * After file edits, emit a short reminder that the indexed context may
      be stale.

There is intentionally NO PreToolUse handling. Earlier versions enriched
every Grep/Glob unconditionally with importers/dependencies/symbols; in
practice this added noise on the >70% of searches where the agent had
already located what it wanted. PostToolUse is strictly more informed —
it can see the actual result count — and is the only entry point now.

Operational invariants:
  * No LLM calls, no network. Pure local SQLite + Python.
  * Cold start budget: well under the 10s hook timeout. Heavy imports
    (sqlalchemy, asyncio) are deferred until we actually have work.
  * Graceful failure: any unexpected error exits 0 with empty stdout
    so a repowise problem never surfaces in the agent transcript.

# session has Read and Edited, keyed by the hook payload's session_id. Two
# behaviors ride on it:
#
#   * Stale-read notice — a Read of a file whose previous Read predates a
#     recorded Edit/Write gets a one-line "earlier excerpts are stale" flag.
#   * Skeleton nudge — a large Read of an indexed file gets a pointer at
#     get_context(include=["skeleton"]) with a bounds-arithmetic estimate.
#
# Rate limiting is the state file itself (per-file, per-session lists), NOT
# the _claim_emission temp marker — that TTL-based dedup only suppresses the
# two concurrently-registered hooks racing on one tool event, which still
# applies on top. A new session_id resets the state.
