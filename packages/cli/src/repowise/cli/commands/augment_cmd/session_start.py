"""Claude Code SessionStart: index freshness + tool-protocol context block.

The generated CLAUDE.md is static between reindexes; what it cannot carry is
whether the index is current *right now*. This handler closes that gap with a
short per-session block so the agent starts with calibrated trust instead of
discovering staleness mid-task:

  * index current  → one line saying so, plus the core-tool pointer;
  * update running → positive "catching up" notice (never a stale scare);
  * index behind   → indexed vs HEAD with a changed-file count, and the
    target-scoped trust rule (stale_warning only when a served file changed).

Deliberately no hotspot/health lines here: CLAUDE.md already carries those
statically, and this block is re-billed every session; freshness is the only
signal that must be live.

Same operational rules as the rest of augment: stdlib + git subprocess only,
any failure returns None, and a git failure never produces a false "current"
claim (it degrades to the freshness-free reminder).
