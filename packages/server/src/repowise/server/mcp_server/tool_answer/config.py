# 40-line synthesis cap on docstring and truncates the actual logic, forcing

# pointer list is exactly what triggers the agent's get_symbol/get_context drill.

# improvement to the tool and was the failure mode that hid the entire
# get_answer rework behind a cache hit during testing.
# v3: retrieval pipeline overhaul (hybrid FTS+vector, PageRank bias, graph
# expansion, structured prelude, decision fusion). Cached v2 payloads were
# synthesised over weaker retrieval — bumping forces re-synthesis so the
# upgrade actually reaches callers without waiting for cache expiry.

# expanded hedge markers). Cached v3 confidence values predate the gates
# and can carry confidently-asserted ungrounded values.

# the consumer skips the get_symbol follow-up. Cached v4 payloads lack it.
# v6: frame-grounding gate — why-answers naming a mechanism term absent from
# the retrieval corpus downgrade high→medium. Cached v5 payloads predate the
# gate and can carry a confidently-asserted, conflated "because X" frame.
