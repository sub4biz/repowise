"""MCP Tool: get_answer — RAG-style synthesis over the wiki layer.

Single-call retrieval + LLM synthesis. Replaces the agent's multi-turn
search → context → read loop with one tool call that returns:

    {
      "answer":            str   — 2–5 sentence synthesised answer
      "citations":         list  — file paths backing the answer
      "confidence":        str   — "high" | "medium" | "low"
      "fallback_targets":  list  — top retrieval hits the agent should Read
                                   to verify (always present)
      "retrieval":         list  — raw top-N hits with snippets
      "symbol_bodies":     list  — full live body of each question-named
                                   definition (collapses the get_symbol
                                   follow-up); present only when the answer
                                   names a function/method/class that was
                                   hydrated
      "more_definitions":  list    only on an answer-by-union (homonym) reply
                                   whose bodies overflowed the char budget:
                                   {file, name, line, symbol_id, hint} entries
                                   the agent fetches with get_symbol, not Read
    }

Answer-by-union: when the question names a symbol with N>=2 definitions no
qualifier disambiguates (``_severity_for`` x 4), the tool returns the UNION of
their bodies in ``symbol_bodies`` (grounding="exact_symbol", confidence="high")
rather than a best_guesses pointer list (the pointer list is what triggers the
agent's get_symbol/get_context drill). A qualified miss (``Parent.leaf`` matching
no def) returns not-found instead of guessing a same-named symbol elsewhere.

When no LLM provider is configured, the tool degrades to retrieval-only
mode (returns ranked hits + snippets, confidence="low") so C1 / index-only
deployments still benefit from the structured single-call shortcut.

This module is the orchestrator only: the retrieval re-rankers, symbol
hydration, provider resolution, confidence predicate, tuning constants, and
prompts live in sibling modules (``retrieval``, ``symbols``, ``synthesis``,
``confidence``, ``config``).
