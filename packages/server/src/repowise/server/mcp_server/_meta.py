"""Shared `_meta` envelope helpers for MCP tool responses.

Every tool can attach a small `_meta` dict to its response with timing and
optional hint text. The hint is the killer feature: a short, conservative
nudge toward the cheaper next-tool when one obviously applies. Hints are
intentionally narrow — pushing every agent toward `get_symbol` regardless of
question shape would replicate the over-trust failure mode that drove
jcodemunch's accuracy regression on alive-with-dead-exports tasks.

Rules of thumb baked into the hint generators:
  * NEVER suggest a more compact tool when the original question contains
    explanation words ("explain", "why", "how does", "what is the relationship",
    "describe").
  * Only suggest get_symbol when the agent has already pinpointed a single
    symbol or single file — never as a starting move.
  * Hints are advisory; the harness/agent is free to ignore them.

    Calibrated to fire ``stale_warning`` rarely so the agent keeps trusting
