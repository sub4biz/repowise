"""Language specification registry data — one module per language.

Each ``specs/<tag>.py`` defines a single ``SPEC`` (a
:class:`~repowise.core.ingestion.languages.spec.LanguageSpec`). This package
aggregates them into ``ALL_SPECS`` in a stable, deliberate order: the
extension-to-language map is built first-spec-wins, so order is significant
(e.g. TypeScript before JavaScript). Adding a language = drop a new
``specs/<tag>.py`` module and slot it into ``ALL_SPECS`` below.
