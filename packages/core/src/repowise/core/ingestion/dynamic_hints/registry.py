"""Aggregates every dynamic-hint extractor and runs them concurrently.

Each extractor walks the repo independently looking for language-specific
runtime/dynamic call signals (Django URL routes, Spring annotations,
pytest fixtures, etc.). The walks are I/O-bound and entirely independent,
so they're fanned out across a thread pool — the Python GIL is released
during ``read_text`` / ``os.walk`` syscalls, which is where the time
actually goes.

Combined with the pruned :func:`._walk.iter_glob` that skips
``node_modules`` / ``.venv`` / ``.next`` / ``__pycache__`` etc. at the
point of traversal, the phase that used to stall multi-minute on polyrepos
now completes in seconds on most codebases regardless of language mix.
