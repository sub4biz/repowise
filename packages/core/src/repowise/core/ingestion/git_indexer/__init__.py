"""Git history indexer for the repowise ingestion pipeline.

Mines git history into the git_metadata table. Uses gitpython for git
operations and parallelises per-file git log calls.

Non-blocking: if git is unavailable or the repo has no history, a warning is
logged and an empty summary returned. All downstream features degrade
gracefully.

The indexer is tiered (:class:`GitIndexTier`): ``FULL`` (default) preserves the
historical behaviour exactly, while ``ESSENTIAL`` skips the two expensive
signals — per-file ``git blame`` and the repo-wide co-change walk — for fast
large-repo indexing. :func:`~.backfill.backfill_full_tier` promotes an
ESSENTIAL index to FULL afterwards.

This package was split out of a single 1k-line module; the public import path
(``repowise.core.ingestion.git_indexer``) is unchanged.
