"""Tree-sitter walker → CCN, max nesting, cognitive complexity.

One AST pass per file. For each function/method discovered at the top
level (or nested directly inside a class body / impl block) we recurse
through its body, accumulating:

- **CCN** — McCabe cyclomatic complexity. Start at 1; +1 per branch /
  loop / case / catch / boolean operator.
- **max_nesting** — deepest stack of nesting-contributing nodes within
  the function body.
- **cognitive** — a weighted nesting score: each nesting node
  adds ``1 + current_depth`` (so deeper nesting hurts more); boolean
  operators add a flat +1; jumps (``return``/``break``/``continue``)
  do not contribute (kept simple in v1).

Anonymous functions (lambdas, arrow functions, closures) recurse for
their containing function's metrics when they are nested in a named
function. Module-level lambdas, such as route callbacks, produce their
own ``FunctionComplexity`` row.

This module is the orchestrator: ``walk_file`` parses the source once and
drives the individual passes, each of which lives in its own sibling module:

- ``models``         — the output dataclasses
- ``ast_utils``      — name/text helpers, function-node collection, params
- ``nloc``           — non-blank / non-comment line counting
- ``cyclomatic``     — the CCN / cognitive / nesting engine
- ``assertions``     — assertion-block detection (test-quality)
- ``error_handling`` — error-handling anti-patterns
- ``perf_walk``      — the performance-risk pass
- ``class_analysis`` — class-level LCOM4 / god-class metrics
