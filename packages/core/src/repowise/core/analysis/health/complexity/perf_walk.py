"""Performance-risk detection (the ``performance`` health dimension).

io_in_loop / string_concat_in_loop / blocking_sync_in_async and the Phase-7
loop-level / centrality-gated markers.

One whole-tree pass mirroring ``_collect_error_handling`` but carrying the
per-node context the perf signal needs: loop depth, in-async, lock depth, and
the enclosing function name. Two non-negotiable refinements (Phase-0 gate: they
took precision from 49% to 79%) are baked in:
  1. Loop-BODY scoping — only calls under a loop node's ``body`` field run
     per-iteration; a call in the ``for x in <iterable>`` header runs once.
  2. Constant-bound-loop skip — ``for _ in range(<int literals>)`` and loops
     over literal / ALL_CAPS-named-constant collections are not data-dependent.

The pass is language-agnostic: it looks up ``PERF_DIALECTS[language]`` and
drives the DFS off the dialect's predicates, early-outing when none is
registered.
