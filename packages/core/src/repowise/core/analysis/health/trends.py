"""Snapshot diffing + trend alerts.

Consumed by:
  * the snapshot writer (``persistence/crud.py.save_health_snapshot``) which
    feeds in the rolling window
  * the ``repowise health --trend`` CLI flag (prints the 10 most recent
    snapshots' KPIs side-by-side)
  * the MCP ``get_health(include=["trend"])`` response

Two alert kinds are emitted, matching plan §4 Phase 4 P4.1:

  * ``declining`` — current ``hotspot_health`` is ≥ ``DECLINE_THRESHOLD``
    points (default 0.5) below the snapshot N-5 entries ago. This catches
    sustained drops, not single-snapshot noise.
  * ``predicted_decline`` — the three most recent snapshots are each
    strictly below the one before them. Magnitude is not required —
    direction is the signal.

The module is intentionally state-free. Callers pass in the snapshot
history (oldest → newest) and receive a list of alerts back. No DB
access lives here so trend logic stays unit-testable without an engine
or a session.
