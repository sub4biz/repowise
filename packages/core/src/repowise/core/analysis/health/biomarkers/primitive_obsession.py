"""Primitive Obsession — long parameter lists of unstructured values.

A proxy for the OOP smell: when a function signature carries 5+ raw
parameters, the call sites usually pass strings/ints/bools that *should*
be a value object. We don't try to inspect parameter *types* (too much
language-specific machinery) — the raw count is a strong-enough
correlation in practice.

Constructors (`__init__`, `init`) get a small grace allowance — wide
dataclass-style ctors are an idiomatic pattern, not a smell.

A wide signature only counts as obsession in a file with enough substance to
*have* a design (`_MIN_FILE_NLOC`). In a tiny module a long parameter list is
almost always an idiomatic config/builder/forwarder entry point rather than a
value object that wants extracting — and an empirical defect-prediction analysis
across a 13-repo corpus confirmed the firing is anti-predictive there (it flags
clean small utility files), inverting discrimination on the small-file size
band. The floor keeps the smell where it carries signal without touching its
scoring weight; larger modules and the per-function param logic are unchanged.
