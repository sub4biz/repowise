"""Per-file score aggregation + repo-level KPIs.

Each file starts at 10.0. Biomarker findings deduct; deductions are
capped per category so no single category can drive the score below the
cap. Final score is clamped to [1.0, 10.0].

The recalibrated category caps (plan §3.1):

    organizational        -> -3.5   # was -1.0 (process-aware signals)
    structural_complexity -> -2.5   # was -3.5
    test_coverage         -> -2.0
    size_and_complexity   -> -1.5   # was -2.0
    duplication           -> -1.0   # was -1.5

Per-biomarker weight multipliers (plan §3.2 Option A) are applied to
the per-finding raw deduction *before* category capping, so the strongest
empirical predictors are no longer suppressed by uniform severity values.
