"""Base provider interface and response types for repowise's LLM abstraction layer.

repowise is model-agnostic by design. Any LLM — cloud or local — that implements
BaseProvider can be used for documentation generation without changing any other code.

Adding a new provider:
    1. Create a new module in this package (e.g., providers/my_provider.py)
    2. Subclass BaseProvider and implement generate(), provider_name, model_name
    3. Register it in registry.py (or call register_provider() at runtime)
    4. Add tests in tests/providers/
    See CONTRIBUTING.md for a step-by-step walkthrough.
